# Simple Bank Account Management System
This project is a simple bank account management system built to practice my knowledge of some technologies. 
It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on bank accounts and manage account balances. 
The system includes basic authentication using database users, a Swagger UI endpoint for easy interaction with the API, and is Dockerized for easier deployment.
