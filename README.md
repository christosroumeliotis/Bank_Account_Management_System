# Simple Bank Account Management System
This project is a simple bank account management system built to practice my knowledge of some technologies. It allows a user to operate basic CRUD actions to bank accounts, and handle account balances.
The system features basic authentication using database users, a Swagger UI endpoint for easy interaction with the API, and is Dockerized for easy deployment.
